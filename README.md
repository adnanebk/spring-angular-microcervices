this is a Crud application that has been developed by using spring boot (cloud) and angular  with keycloak authentication provider

to test it you have to install keycloak (https://www.keycloak.org/downloads) in your machine and execute it (click standalone.bat) and then register new clients (apps) and users with the role 'user' and make sure to have the same configurations as in your keycloak (client id,secret,...)
